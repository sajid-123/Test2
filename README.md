Answer with Explanation :

Program code :


	for(int i=0; i<n;  i++){
		    
		    
		    
		    for(int j = i; j>0; j--){
		        
		        
		        
		        System.out.print("*");
		        
		    }
		    
		}


Example 1 :

**************Analysis of Bog O notation****************
Suppose n is 5 for the outer loop
1 Iteration of Outer loop 

In the 1 Iteration of outer loop ,Inner loop is not running
2 Iteration of Outer loop 
In the 2 Iteration of outer loop ,Inner loop running 1times
And print *
3 Iteration of Outer loop 
In the 3 Iteration of outer loop ,Inner loop running 2times
And print *
In the 3 Iteration of outer loop ,Inner loop running 3times
And print *
4 Iteration of Outer loop 
In the 4 Iteration of outer loop ,Inner loop running 4times
And print *
In the 4 Iteration of outer loop ,Inner loop running 5times
And print *
In the 4 Iteration of outer loop ,Inner loop running 6times
And print *
5 Iteration of Outer loop 
In the 5 Iteration of outer loop ,Inner loop running 7times
And print *
In the 5 Iteration of outer loop ,Inner loop running 8times
And print *
In the 5 Iteration of outer loop ,Inner loop running 9times
And print *
In the 5 Iteration of outer loop ,Inner loop running 10times
And print *



Result : here we can see the outer loops runs n times and inner loop runs 2*n times 

So the Time Complexity is = n*(2*n)  =>O(n^2)

here we eliminate contsant or the coefficient of n

Result : here we can see the outer loops runs n times and inner loop runs 6.5*n times 

So the Time Complexity is = n*(6.5*n)  =>O(n^2)

here we eliminate contsant or the coefficient of n



Conclusion : As we see inner loop is running twice of the outer loop 

		if our loop runs n times then inner loop runs tolal constant*n times 


		So the Time Complexity is = n*(contant*n) =>  O(n^2) 

		 constant (coefficient) here which we we don't consider
