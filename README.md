Value of in1 is  : 0
Value of in2 is : 9
while loop will run till in1 is less than in2  : 
in 1 iteration of loop Value of values[0] : 5
in 1 iteration of loop Value of values[9] : 2
in 1 iteration of loop Value of 5  is greater than 2
So it enters inside else statement
diffrence calculated  inside else statement in 1  iteration of  loop  is :  3
After adding 1 Value of in1 becomes : 1
After substracting 1 Value of in2 becomes : 8
in 2 iteration of loop Value of values[1] : 16
in 2 iteration of loop Value of values[8] : 8
in 2 iteration of loop Value of 16  is greater than 8
So it enters inside else statement
diffrence calculated  inside else statement in 2  iteration of  loop  is :  8
After adding 1 Value of in1 becomes : 2
After substracting 1 Value of in2 becomes : 7
in 3 iteration of loop Value of values[2] : 7
in 3 iteration of loop Value of values[7] : 19
in 3 iteration of loop Value of 7  is less than 19
So it enters inside if statement
diffrence calculated inside if statement in  3 iteration of  loop  is :  12
After adding 1 Value of in1 becomes : 3
After substracting 1 Value of in2 becomes : 6
in 4 iteration of loop Value of values[3] : 15
in 4 iteration of loop Value of values[6] : 12
in 4 iteration of loop Value of 15  is greater than 12
So it enters inside else statement
diffrence calculated  inside else statement in 4  iteration of  loop  is :  3
After adding 1 Value of in1 becomes : 4
After substracting 1 Value of in2 becomes : 5
in 5 iteration of loop Value of values[4] : 3
in 5 iteration of loop Value of values[5] : 9
in 5 iteration of loop Value of 3  is less than 9
So it enters inside if statement
diffrence calculated inside if statement in  5 iteration of  loop  is :  6
After adding 1 Value of in1 becomes : 5
After substracting 1 Value of in2 becomes : 4
Value of in1 is  : 5
Value of in2 is : 4
while loop has stopped cause in1 greater than to in2   :
